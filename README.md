Go Fish Game in Java

This project is a digital adaptation of the classic card game Go Fish, developed entirely in Java. It implements core game mechanics, including drawing cards, matching ranks, and collecting sets, allowing players to engage in a turn-based competition against a computer opponent. The program showcases object-oriented principles, with classes for handling card decks, players, and game logic, ensuring smooth game flow and a user-friendly interface. This project serves as a practical demonstration of Java's capabilities for creating interactive, rules-based applications while honing skills in algorithm development and game design.
